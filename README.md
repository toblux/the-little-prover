# The Little Prover

I recently read *[The Little Prover](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25545484-the-little-prover)* and this repository contains the exercises and code samples that I did while reading the book.

Please note that this repository was only used to keep track of my progress and it doesn’t make much sense without reading the book which contains most solutions anyway.

I used Chez Scheme, but any other Scheme implementation should do.

Make sure to evaluate `(load "axioms.scm")` only once per session, otherwise your REPL might hang or crash.
